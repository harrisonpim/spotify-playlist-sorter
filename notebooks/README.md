## Running these notebooks locally

If you don't want to go through the process of installing jupyter, resolving environments/requirements etc, just run `docker compose up --build` to build the analysis project in a container. This should start a jupyter lab instance locally with all the dependencies installed, and environment variables pulled in from the parent directory.
